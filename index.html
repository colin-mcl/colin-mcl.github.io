            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <p class="info"> I am a creative, detail-oriented third-year student at Tufts University.
                 I am earning a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Economics and working as a Customer Service Representative for Tufts Technology Services.
                 In this role I am the front line of tech support for Tufts students and faculty. 
                 This requires troubleshooting personal computers and printers, as well as checking in and out laptops in need of repair. 
                 My background in computer science and customer service have given me the interpersonal skills and technical knowledge needed to excel in this role.
            </p>
            <p class="info">    
                I am motivated in work and school by the challenge of solving new problems every day.
                As a member of Future Problem Solvers club throughout middle and high school and a computer science major, I enjoy being presented with a challenge that cannot be solved with a simple equation. 
                At TTS and in school I relish being forced to apply my knowledge and think outside of the box to come up with a solution. 
                I approach problems with a framework of solve-test-assess-modify, which can be applied in tech support and computer programming.
            </p>   
            <p class="info">    
                I am looking for a summer internship in which I will be forced to apply my technical skills and creative problem solving in a production environment.
                My work experience and knowledge of C++, Python and web development provide me a great basis to expand on as I hope to work on challenging projects this summer.
            </p>
