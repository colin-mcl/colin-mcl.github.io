        <h1> About this game</h1>
        <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a basic game that is as old as time. If you have never played it before first of all what rock were you living under.
            Secondly, the goal of the game is to get three of your X's or O's in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent does.
        </p>
        <p> In this version of the game you are playing a CPU (me) that is using a minimax algorithm to make its decisions. A minimax algorithm
            is a backtracking algorithm that can be used on board games with simple endings. In Tic-Tac-Toe, the computer assigns a point value
            to different states of the board. If the board is in a state where X has won, the value is +10. If it is in a state where O has won,
            the value is -10. And if it is in a tie or unfinished state, the value is 0. To choose a move the algorithm goes through each
            possible position it could play. It plays its letter and recursively evaluates the moves that would follow. It then returns the score
            which would result from playing this move. After getting the score of each possible move, the CPU chooses the maximum score if playing
            X's, or the minimum score if playing O's.
