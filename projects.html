        <a href="https://github.com/colin-mcl/colin-mcl.github.io"><h1 class = "project">Personal Website</h1></a>
        <p class = "project info">I made this website as my first foray into a real web-development experience. In fact, my first
            exposure to web-development came in <b>6th grade</b>, when my parents got me a book about HTML and CSS. I loved
            building tiny, useless websites while in class or at home and this was the start of my love for Computer Science! </p>
            
        <p class = "project info"> While building this website I got a much better understanding of the principal concepts of Web
            Development. I utilized CSS flexbox to create the layout of the pages and added media queries to ensure that the site
            displays well on both mobile and desktop. I also got experience using JavaScript to add interactive features. The scrolling
            header on top of the pages, as well as the Tic-Tac-Toe minigame, were both implemented using JS. </p>
        <ul class = "project">Skills Involved:
            <li class="skill">HTML</li>
            <li class="skill">CSS</li>
            <li class="skill">JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1 class="project">Universal Machine</h1>
        <p class="project info">The Universal Machine was a program that we created in COMP 40, one of the most challenging computer
            science courses offered at Tufts. The task was to create a program that emulated the architecture and implementation of
            a low-level computer. Our program would be fed input files in raw binary which could be converted to 32-bit instructions.
            These instructions emulated assembly language and would perform basic operations on a set of memory registers. Some
            operations included waiting for input, printing, basic arithmetic and halting the program. The most difficult requirement
            was the ability to map new memory segments in which future instructions could be stored. With this implemented, complicated
            programs could be run on our emulation by creating segments which stored entire programs, then loading that segment into the
            instruction register.</p>
        <p class="project info"> Implementing the Universal Machine helped us gain a much better understanding of how the execution of 
            a computer program actually occurs. The managing of registers and memory created many challenges but with careful design and
            rigorous unit testing we created a great emulation. After the initial project was finished we analyzed the performance of the UM
            using Callgrind and KCachegrind. We were able to eliminate many code bottlenecks and create an 88% speedup in our program. Finally,
            we used a macro version of the UM assembly language to create a working RPN calculator. </p>

        <a href="https://github.com/colin-mcl/sudoku"><h1 class="project">Sudoku</h1></a>
        <p class="project info">This is a command line C++ program which takes a Sudoku board formatted in text as input. The board
            can have any number of squares filled in and the program will solve the remainder of the board using a backtracking algorithm.
            The algorithm will recursively fill in every square on the board. It will attempt every solution possible at every square and check if
            this leads to a solved board. If it does lead to a solution the algorithm continues. Otherwise, it removes that attempt, tries the
            next possibility and so on. Instead of using an array of integers to store the numbers that are present in each row, column and square,
            the program represents each row, column and square with a bitpacked integer. This means that the least-significant 9 bits of each integer
            represent whether numbers 1-9 have been found yet. This reduces the memory required to store the numbers which have been found on a sudoku board
            from about 7000 bits to just 864. While this does not have a significant impact on the program's runtime, our lessons in locality and performance
            from COMP 40 incentived me to use this solution.</p>
